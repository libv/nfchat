  `----------------------'

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.4.1 -> 1.4.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Compilation fixes for IRIX (David Kaelbling).
 - Compilation fixes for AIX (Rodrigo Barbosa).
 - Compilation fixes for OpenBSD.
 - Should now compile with certain beta/alpha versions of Perl.
 - "Scrollbar snapping to top" bug fixed.

 - Configure script is now generated with a sane version of autoconf.
 - Alt-minus and Alt-plus now wrap around (AGL).


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.4.0 -> 1.4.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Fixed a bug that could make new text not appear while marking text.
 - xtext: Further improved performance when double buffering is turned
          off (marking text & URL hilights are almost flicker free).
 - xtext: Double buffer is now freed at each render operation, this
          should reduce memory usage if you have many tabs open.
 - If you closed a server while it was in the reconnect-delay, xchat
   would crash - fixed.
 - No more zombies when doing /discon while connection in progress.
 - Added "/clear all" command (Paul de Regt).

 - Some Solaris compilation fixes (David Morgan).
 - Danish translation updated (Birger Langkjer).
 - Italian translation updated (Stefano Fava).
 - Greek translation added (Fanis Dokianakis).
 - Dutch translation upated (Arjan Scherpenisse).
 - Removed some very old translations: fr_CA, no, pl, ru and sv.
   (If someone wants to update these, you're welcome to).
 - Channel mode "+h nick" (half Op) is now reported correctly (still
   not supported in the userlist though).
 - Having indent nicks OFF in channel windows and ON in dialog windows
   didn't work - fixed.
 - Sometimes ignores wouldn't save - fixed.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.3.14 -> 1.4.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - xtext: Improved performance when double buffering is turned off
   (/set double_buffer 0 and restart). If you don't use a background
   pixmap, it might be worth a try.
 - No more phantom server logs.
 - pt_BR translation updated (Frederic L. W. Meunier).
 - Fixed a bug in printing text (when indent nicks were off) which
   could cause a buffer overrun.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.3.13 -> 1.3.14
----------------------------------------------------------------------

   xchat would crash - fixed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.3.12 -> 1.3.13
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Rewrote the command execution code for userlist-buttons and popup
   menu. This should fix at least 1 known bug.
 - Blank lines disappeared if you had indent nicks off - fixed.
 - "/reconnect ALL" will now reconnect on all servers.
 - The KWM_WIN_ICON is now set so you can see an icon in KDE and Gnome
   tasklist applet (I just need someone to draw a good 16x16 icon).
 - Smooth tab switching should now work even without a paned userlist.
 - Changing the Tabs' position would mess up the text window - fixed.
   (delinking a window could do a similar thing, also fixed).
 - /lastlog is back.
 - Korean translation updated (Kim SeungBaeck).
 - Fixed a bug in logging the server tab.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.3.11 -> 1.3.12
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - TreeView now removes channels when you close them.
 - Themes support added, themes section on xchat.org coming soon.
   (David Härdeman).
 - xtext: Marking past the page boundry should work now (this is not
          100% yet, but good enough to general use).
 - xtext: Wordwrap should now work properly.
 - xtext: You can now turn off double buffering with
   /set double_buffer 0 (requires a restart), it'll use less RAM & CPU
   but it will flicker a bit.

 - xtext: Added wordwrap option in Setup->ChannelWindows (this is
          broken/incomplete).

              /server irc://<host>[:<port>] [<password>]

   (see Setup->Window Layout).
